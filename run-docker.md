# Running docker on your laptop

1. [Start docker daemon](#start-docker)
2. [Check Docker installation](#check-docker)
3. [Run interactive containers](#run-interactive)
4. [Create a Python image to be converted to Singularity](#create-image) 

### <a name="start-docker"></a> 1. Start docker daemon

Let us first start the docker daemon: 

* Linux: Open a terminal in your laptop and run

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl start docker
    ```
    if the above command fails run 
    ```sh
    sudo service docker start
    ```
* Mac: Start the docker daemon via Launchpad.

* Windows: Search for Docker, select Docker for Windows in the search results, and click it (or hit Enter)
 
  
### <a name="check-docker"></a> 2. Check the docker installation

* Getting started: Run the following commands in a terminal 

    ```sh
    docker --version
    docker info
    docker image ls
    docker container ls --all
    ```

Image: An image  is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application.    
Container: A container is a runtime instance of an image - what the image becomes when executed. 

* Run the following command and see what happens: 

    ```sh
    docker run hello-world
    docker image ls  # can you see your hello-world image?
    docker container ls --all   # can you see your hello-world container?
    ```  
    
> **_Food for brain:_**
>
> * How come you ran a container when you didn't have the image in the first place?
>   Hint: look into what happened when you ran the first command 
    
### <a name="run-interactive"></a> 3. Run interactive containers

* The following command downloads the latest bash image and runs it in the interactive mode

   ```sh
   docker run -it bash
   ls #run similar linux commands to see what the environment looks like
   exit
   docker container ls -all  # or docker ps -a
   ```
   -i: This starts the container in interactive mode   
   -t: Allocates a pseudo-TTY
   
> **_Food for brain:_**
>
> * You just exited the container but looks like it is stll hanging around. Can you explain?

   
By default a containerâ€™s file system persists even after the container exits. To remove the container (this does not remove the image) you should run

   ```sh
   docker rm container-name # replace with your container-name
   docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) # this removes all stopped containers
   ```
   
Now let's run the latest Ubuntu in a container!

   ```sh
   docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/my-first-docker ubuntu /bin/bash 
   ```
   
  --rm: Docker will automatically clean up the container and remove the file system when the container exits  
  -v: this mounts a file or directory on the host machine into a container
 
   
   ```sh
   cat /etc/os-release
   whoami
   cd /my-first-docker #Whatever changes you make in this directory will also be made on your host so be careful!
   echo "Hello World!" > hello-world.txt
   ls
   exit
   ls
   ```
  
So despite having different machines with different OS and OS versions you had one thing running in common - the latest Ubuntu!
    
### <a name="create-image"></a> 4. Create Python images to be converted to Singularity

Let's create a Python image using a Dockerfile
   ```sh
   mkdir my-python2-container
   cd my-python2-container/
   vi (check which editor Carlos used) Dockerfile
   ```
   Dockerfile: A file that contains all the commands used to assemble an image. 
   
The contents of the Dockerfile should look like this:
   ```sh
   # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
   FROM python:2.7 
   # Copy the Python script to the container
   ADD python2.py . 
   # Install any needed packages 
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y vim
   # Run my-python2-script.py when the container launches
   CMD ["python", "./python2.py"]
   ```
   While saving the Dockerfile, do not add any extension (.txt,.doc) to the file. We will also run a simple Python script with this image. Make sure you have this script in your current working directory (Open the [script](https://github.com/maithili-k/singularity-course/blob/master/python2.py) and copy its contents using your favourite editor and save the file). Now let's build an image from the Dockerfile and run it
   
   ```sh
   docker build -t python2-docker .
   docker images # You should see the image we just created
   docker run --rm python2-docker 
   docker run -it --rm python2-docker /bin/bash # For an interactive session
   python python2.py # you can run the python script that now resides in your container
   exit
   ```

So in a short amount of time, you just ran a Python script in a Python version that was probably different than the one on your laptop, and ran the latest version of Ubuntu without installing either one of it!
