# Running docker on your workstation

1. [Start docker daemon](#start-docker)
2. [Test Docker installation](#check-docker)
3. [Run interactive containers](#run-interactive)

### <a name="start-docker"></a> 1. Start docker daemon

* Linux: Open a terminal in your laptop and run

    ```sh
    $sudo systemctl start docker
    ```
    if the above command fails run 
    ```sh
    $sudo service docker start
    ```
* Mac: Start the docker daemon via Launchpad.

* Windows: Search for Docker, select Docker for Windows in the search results, and click it (or hit Enter)
 
  
### <a name="check-docker"></a> 2. Check the docker installation

* Getting started: Run the following commands in a terminal 

    ```sh
    $docker --version
    $docker info
    $docker image ls
    $docker container ls --all
    ```

Image: An image  is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application.    
Container: A container is a runtime instance of an image--what the image becomes when executed. 

* This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. 


    ```sh
    $docker run hello-world
    $docker image ls  # can you see your hello-world image?
    $docker container ls --all   # can you see your hello-world container?
    ```  
    
### <a name="run-interactive"></a> 3. Run interactive containers

* The following command downloads the latest bash image and runs it in the interactive mode

   ```sh
   $docker run -it bash
   $ls #run similar bash commands to see what the environment looks like
   $exit
   $docker container ls -all  # or docker ps -a
   ```
   -i: This starts the container in interactive mode
   -t: Allocates a pseudo-TTY
   
By default a containerâ€™s file system persists even after the container exits. To remove the container (this does not remove the image) you should run

   ```sh
   $docker rm container-name # replace with your container-name
   $docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) # this removes all stopped containers
   ```
   
Now let's run two Python versions in separate containers. You may use the following two commands in two separate terminals, or 
run one container at a time, exit and start the next one

   ```sh
   $docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/output --entrypoint /bin/bash python:2.7
   $docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/output --entrypoint /bin/bash python
   ```
   
   Do the ubuntu one with dockerfile
   docker run -it --rm -v $PWD ubuntu /bin/bash
